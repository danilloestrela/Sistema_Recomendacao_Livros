# yan Python Project

This project uses **Docker**, **Docker Compose**, and the [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) package manager for fast and reliable Python dependency management.

## Prerequisites
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) installed
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) installed

## Quick Start

### 1. Clone the repository
```sh
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd yan
```

### 2. Configure Environment Variables
Edit the `.env` file to set your environment variables as needed.

### 3. Build the Docker Image
```sh
make build
```

### 4. Run the Application
```sh
make up
```
This will start the app and mount your code for live reload.

### 5. Stop the Application
```sh
make down
```

### 6. Access the Container Shell
```sh
make shell
```

### 7. View Logs
```sh
make logs
```

### 8. Run Tests (if you add tests)
```sh
make test
```

## Using uv for Dependency Management
This project uses [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) for fast, reliable Python dependency management inside Docker. All dependencies are listed in `requirements.txt`.

- To add a new dependency, update `requirements.txt` and rebuild the Docker image.

## Troubleshooting
- If you encounter issues with dependencies, try rebuilding the Docker image: `make build`
- Ensure your `.env` file is correctly configured.

---

Feel free to open issues or contribute! 

1. **A `make configure` command** in the Makefile, which will copy `.env.example` to `.env` if `.env` does not exist, making it easy to set up environment variables.
2. **A `.env.example` template** (please create or update this file manually, as my write was blocked) with all required and normal environment variables for your project.
3. **A `.gitignore`** that covers Python, Docker, virtualenv, and common editor files, ensuring sensitive and unnecessary files (like `.env`) are not committed to git.

**How to use:**
- Run `make configure` to quickly set up your `.env` file from the example.
- Edit `.env` as needed for your environment.

If you need the `.env.example` content, here it is for you to create manually:

```env
# Example .env file for yan project
# Copy this file to .env and edit as needed

# Required variables
DEBUG=True
DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///yan.db

# Add more variables as needed
```

Let me know if you want to add more variables or need further automation! 

There is currently no `requirements.txt` file in your project root directory.

This file is necessary for specifying your Python dependencies (such as `pandas` and any RL library you want). It should be present for Docker and uv to install your dependencies correctly.

**To fix this:**
- If you have a list of dependencies, I can create a `requirements.txt` for you.
- If you want to generate it from your current virtual environment, you can run:
  ```sh
  pip freeze > requirements.txt
  ```
  and then commit the file.

Would you like me to create a starter `requirements.txt` with `pandas` and a recommended RL library, or do you want to specify the dependencies yourself?
